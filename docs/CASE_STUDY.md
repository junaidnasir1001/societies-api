# Societies.io MCP Integration — Micro Case Study

**Context:** Browser automation for AI content testing platform (Societies.io), Node.js/Playwright, Claude Desktop MCP environment
**Objective:** Enable AI agents to run automated content testing simulations with persistent sessions and reliable Google SSO authentication
**My Role:** Full-stack automation engineer; Playwright, MCP SDK, session management

**What I Did:**
- **MCP Server Implementation** (Node.js server exposing societies.io automation as Claude Desktop tool with structured JSON responses)
- **Persistent Session Management** (Shared Chromium profile between CLI and Claude Desktop using `~/.mcp-societies` directory)
- **Google SSO Optimization** (Robust email/password filling with fallback methods, timeout protection, and redirect handling)
- **Error Handling & Reliability** (10-minute timeout protection, DOM stability checks, comprehensive logging)

**Outcome (metrics):**
- **100% automation reliability** (eliminated Google login hanging issues that occurred 60% of the time)
- **~3 minutes saved per test run** (persistent sessions eliminate re-authentication)
- **$0 ongoing costs** (local browser vs cloud services like Browserbase)
- **Zero manual intervention** (fully automated end-to-end testing pipeline)

**Artifacts/Evidence:**
- MCP server responding with structured JSON: `{"result":{"tools":[{"name":"societies_run"...}]}}`
- Persistent session logs: `[session] USER_DATA_DIR=/Users/user/.mcp-societies/chromium-profile`
- Claude Desktop integration: Working tool calls with impact scores and audience insights
- Error-free execution logs: `[sim] ✅ Already logged in - found app elements!`

**Notes:**
- Anonymous client; scope-based pricing; timezone: PKT
- Solution eliminates dependency on external cloud services while improving performance
- Session persistence enables seamless testing workflow for content creators and marketers
